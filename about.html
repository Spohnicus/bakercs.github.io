      <p>
        Welcome aboard the BCSC crew's webpage! This is the Baker Computer Science Club's self-made website. 
        We are essentially the club devoted to education in the computer sciences, and we begin diving head-first 
        into the computer science field, which is one of the highest - payed underpopulated fields in the world.
        Jobs include high-level ITs to website development (from which you could work in your own house!) to
        security jobs or even -- wait for it -- Game Development.
